    "text": "If you are an R Markdown user wondering about the relationship between Quarto and R Markdown, see also our FAQ for R Markdown Users.\n\nWhat can I use Quarto for?\nQuarto® is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc. You can weave together narrative text and code to produce elegantly formatted output as documents, web pages, blog posts, books and more. \n\n\n\nHow do I install Quarto?\nVisit the Quarto.org Get Started page, which provides installation instructions for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. \n\n\n\nIs Quarto free to use?\nYes! Quarto is open source with a GPL-2 license. You can use or disseminate it any way that you would any GPL-2 licensed open source software. \n\n\nWhat output formats can Quarto create?\nThere are many output formats available in Quarto. This includes all of the built in Pandoc formats (e.g. HTML, PDF, MS Word, Revealjs, ePub, etc.) as well as various ways to publish multiple documents (websites, blogs, and books). Learn more at Quarto Formats. \n\n\nWhat editing tools can I use with Quarto?\nYou can use a wide variety of tools with Quarto. We have provided documentation for writing and editing Quarto documents in VSCode, JupyterLab, RStudio IDE, or any text editor. Visit the Get Started with Quarto page to install, and then choose your tool for a brief introductory guide.\n\n\nCan I use Jupyter notebooks with Quarto?\nYes! Quarto can render Jupyter notebooks and you can use Jupyter, JupyterLab or any other .ipynb notebook editor with Quarto. You can render existing .ipynb notebooks as-is with Quarto, but adding Quarto-specific output options or a YAML header can enhance the output. Visit theJupyterLab page for more information.\n\n\nWhat programming languages are supported in Quarto?\nThe principal languages supported by Quarto are Python, R, Julia, and Observable JavaScript. Integration with Jupyter also enables the use of many other languages. \nEach Quarto document can be optionally processed by a computational engine (the engine can be manually specified or automatically detected based on the code chunks within). Current engines include Knitr (which is also used by R Markdown and supports a variety of languages including R, Python, and Julia, etc.) and Jupyter (which supports many languages including Python, Julia, and R). See the documentation on Engine Binding for additional details.\n\n\nWhat human languages are supported in Quarto?\nYou can write your Quarto documentation in your human language of choice. The lang document option is used to identify the main language of the document using IETF language tags (following the BCP 47 standard), such as en or en-GB. \n\n\nCan I use Quarto to develop proprietary content?\nYes! The copyright on Quarto does not cover the original content that you generate using Quarto. Using Quarto to create original content does not place any restrictions, legally, on the license that you choose for the original content that you create, nor does it “reach through” to affect software that you might be writing documentation for with Quarto.\n\n\nBut doesn’t the GPL cover exported HTML documents when they include styles or functionalities from Quarto?\nIt covers the styles or functionalities themselves. It does not cover your original content because your original content is not a derivative work of the Quarto styles or functionalities.\n\n\nHow can I share documents and have people comment on them?\nYou can publish Quarto content to various locations. See the user guides for publishing for details on using Quarto Pub, GitHub Pages, Netlify, Posit Connect, and other services with Quarto. Once documents are published you can use  hypothes.is, Utterances, or Giscus for commenting. Learn more in the documentation on commenting.\n\n\nCan I do collaborative editing with Quarto?\nThere is not yet anything specific for collaborative editing in Quarto. You can collaborate on .qmd files in the same way you currently do for any text or code files. \nPosit Workbench allows for Project Sharing for interactive editing and collaboration on the same document.\n\n\nWhere can I publish Quarto websites?\nThere are a wide variety of ways to publish Quarto websites. Website content is by default written to the \\_site sub-directory (you can customize this using the output-dir option). Publishing is simply a matter of copying the output directory to a web server or web hosting service.\nThe publishing documentation describes several convenient options for Quarto website deployment including Posit Connect, Netlify, GitHub Pages, Firebase, Site44, and Amazon S3. We’ll mostly defer to the documentation provided by those various services, but will note any Quarto website specific configuration required.\n\n\nDoes Posit Connect support Quarto?\nYes! You can publish Quarto content to Posit Connect v2021.08.0 or later. Quarto has to be enabled as documented in the Posit Connect admin guide. Connect’s user documentation refers to Quarto.org docs on how to publish from the RStudio IDE. To publish Python-based Quarto content, you can use the rsconnect-python CLI from various locations, including VSCode, JupyterLab or the terminal.\n\n\nWho are the developers of Quarto?\nDevelopment of Quarto is sponsored by Posit, PBC. The same core team works on both Quarto and R Markdown:\n\nCarlos Scheidegger (@cscheid)\nCharles Teague (@dragonstyle)\nChristophe Dervieux (@cderv)\nJ.J. Allaire (@jjallaire)\nYihui Xie (@yihui)\n\nHere is the full contributors list. Quarto is open source and we welcome contributions in our github repository as well! https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli.\n\n\nWhy the name Quarto?\nWe wanted to use a name that had meaning in the history of publishing and landed on Quarto, which is the format of a book or pamphlet produced from full sheets printed with eight pages of text, four to a side, then folded twice to produce four leaves. The earliest known European printed book is a Quarto, the Sibyllenbuch, believed to have been printed by Johannes Gutenberg in 1452–53.\n\n\nWhere can I report bugs or request features?\nThanks for finding something and sharing with us! You can file an issue in the Quarto repository https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues.\n\n\nWhere can I ask questions and discuss using Quarto with others?\nThe best place to ask questions and see what questions other people have is in Quarto discussions (https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions)."

    "title": "FAQ for R Markdown Users",
    "section": "",
    "text": "What can I use Quarto for?\nQuarto® is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc. You can weave together narrative text and code to produce elegantly formatted output as documents, web pages, blog posts, books and more. \n\n\nQuarto sounds similar to R Markdown. What is the difference and why create a new project?\nAt its core, Quarto works the same way as R Markdown: \n\nThe goal of Quarto is to make the process of creating and collaborating on scientific and technical documents dramatically better. Quarto combines the functionality of R Markdown, bookdown, distill, xaringian, etc into a single consistent system with “batteries included” that reflects everything we’ve learned from R Markdown over the past 10 years.\nThe number of languages and runtimes used for scientific discourse is very broad (and the Jupyter ecosystem in particular is extraordinarily popular). Quarto is at its core multi-language and multi-engine (supporting Knitr, Jupyter, and Observable today and potentially other engines tomorrow).\nOn the other hand, R Markdown is fundamentally tied to R which severely limits the number of practitioners it can benefit. Quarto is Posit’s attempt to bring R Markdown to everyone! Unlike R Markdown, Quarto doesn’t have a dependency or requirement for R. Quarto was developed to be multilingual, beginning with R, Python, Javascript, and Julia, with the idea that it will work even for languages that don’t yet exist.\nWhile it is a “new” system, it should also be noted that it is highly compatible with existing content: you can render most R Markdown documents and Jupyter notebooks unmodified with Quarto. The concept is to make a major, long term investment in reproducible research, while keeping it compatible with existing formats and adaptable to the various environments users work in.\n\n\nIs R Markdown going away? Will my R Markdown documents continue to work?\nR Markdown is not going away! R Markdown is used extensively and continues to work well. It will continue to be actively supported. We’re not leaving R Markdown, we’re expanding our scope. Over the years there have been many feature requests, and rather than implementing them all in R Markdown, for certain features we may refer you to Quarto. Everything that is currently in R Markdown will continue to work and be supported. There are no plans for deprecation.\nRead more about this in Yihui Xie’s blog post With Quarto Coming, is R Markdown Going Away? No.\n\n\nShould I switch from R Markdown to Quarto?\nIf you like using R Markdown, there’s no need to switch! R Markdown will continue to be supported and work as it always has been. You’re welcome to try Quarto if you like, but there’s no need to switch. Some new features may only exist in Quarto, so if you want to use those, then that’s where you would give those a try.  \nWe should emphasize that switching is not imperative. While we don’t plan on major feature initiatives in R Markdown and related packages, we are going to continue to maintain them (smaller improvements and bug fixes) for a long time to come. Furthermore, since Rmd files can in most cases be rendered without modification by Quarto, you can continue using R Markdown and the switching cost will still be minimal whenever you decide to do it. \n\n\nI use X (bookdown, blogdown, etc.). What is the Quarto equivalent?\nHere are the Quarto equivalents for various packages and features of the R Markdown ecosystem (in some cases Quarto equivalents are not yet available but will be later this year):\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nR Markdown\nQuarto\n\n\n\n\nBasic Formats\n\nhtml_document\npdf_document\nword_document\n\n\nhtml\npdf\ndocx\n\n\n\nBeamer\n\nbeamer_presentation\n\n\nbeamer\n\n\n\nPowerPoint\n\npowerpoint_presentation\n\n\npptx\n\n\n\nHTML Slides\n\nxaringan\nioslides\nrevealjs\n\n\nrevealjs\n\n\n\nAdvanced Layout\n\ntufte\ndistill\n\n\nQuarto Article Layout\n\n\n\nCross References\n\nhtml_document2\npdf_document2\nword_document2\n\n\nQuarto Crossrefs\n\n\n\nWebsites & Blogs\n\nblogdown\ndistill\n\n\nQuarto Websites\nQuarto Blogs\n\n\n\nBooks\n\nbookdown\n\n\nQuarto Books\n\n\n\nInteractivity\nShiny Documents\nQuarto Interactive Documents\n\n\nJournal Articles\nrticles\nQuarto Journal Articles\n\n\nPaged HTML\npagedown\nPlanned\n\n\nDashboards\nflexdashboard\nPlanned\n\n\nInteractive Tutorials\nlearnr\nNo equivalent planned\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you create custom formats for Quarto like you can for R Markdown?\nQuarto offers an Extension mechanism to add features to a format using Shortcodes or Filters but also create custom formats. A major difference with custom output format in R Markdown is that Quarto Extension does not use R but Lua, for example if you need to add some logic behind custom metadata fields. See Developing with Lua to get started if you need use it your extension. Some of the features from R Markdown custom formats like customizing knitting behavior can also now be done in YAML with execution options.\nAs example of custom formats for Quarto, Journal Articles for Quarto are port of some custom output format inside the rticles R package. Extensions lives in Quarto Journals Github organization, and you can find information on how to customize templates and manage Authors for you format.\nIf you are an advanced developer of R Markdown custom format, the Extension mechanism may still have limitation (like pre and post processor). The Extension feature in Quarto will be improved over time - do not hesitate to share with us your use case or wished in our Discussion Board.\n\n\nWhen would be a good time to start new projects in Quarto rather than R Markdown?\nQuarto v1.0 was announced at rstudio::conf(2022). This is the first stable release which is already an excellent foundation for starting new projects with Quarto or migrating existing R Markdown projects (if you are so inclined). If you start using Quarto, please do stay updated with latest release and changes as development is very active.\n\n\nDoes the RStudio IDE support Quarto?\nYes! You need to use RStudio v2022.07 or a later version, which includes support for editing and preview of Quarto documents.\nYou can download the latest release (v2023.03) of RStudio v2023.03 from https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/.\n\n\nDoes Posit Connect support Quarto?\nYes! You can publish Quarto content to Posit Connect v2021.08.0 or later. Quarto has to be enabled as documented in the Posit Connect admin guide. Connect’s user documentation refers to Quarto.org docs on how to publish from the RStudio IDE. To publish Python-based Quarto content, you can use the rsconnect-python CLI from various locations, including VSCode, JupyterLab or the terminal."

But when processing the document, the callout divs are now represented as a custom AST node, which can be processed directly in Lua filters. In Quarto 1.3, callouts can be captured in Lua filters more directly. For example, here is a filter that forces every callout to be of type “caution”:\nfunction Callout(callout)\n  -- do something with the callout\n  callout.type = \"caution\"\n\n  -- note that custom AST nodes are passed by reference. You can\n  -- return the value if you choose, but you do not need to.\nend\nFinally, custom AST node constructors are available in the quarto object: quarto.Callout, quarto.Tabset, etc. See the pages above for details."

    "section": "Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nIn Quarto 1.3, we have made some changes to how tables are processed. Recent Pandoc versions have added support for parsing HTML tables into Pandoc’s native data structures (including features such as rowspans and colspans), and Quarto now leverages this to make it easier to produce properly formatted tables in more formats.\n\nHTML tables are now processed in every format\nSpecifically, Quarto will now attempt to parse HTML tables in RawBlock nodes in html format and convert them to Markdown tables, regardless of output format (intentionally including non-HTML formats). As a result, you can now use HTML table syntax in your documents and they will be properly converted to Markdown tables for all formats, and libraries which emit computational tables in HTML format can work in other output formats. In addition, this will allow Lua filters to manipulate the content of tables specified in HTML format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you’re a library author, we hope that you will consider emitting HTML tables in your output. This will allow your users to use the full power of Quarto’s table processing in all formats.\nWith that said, it’s possible that our processing of HTML tables interferes with your library’s processing. If this is the case, you can disable Quarto’s processing of HTML tables by adding the following data attribute to your table:\n<table data-quarto-disable-processing=\"true\">\n  ...\n</table>\n\n\n\n\nBootstrap classes can be added to tables\nBootstrap table classes given as attributes next to a table caption are now inserted into the <table> element. The classes permitted are those that apply expressly to the entire table, and these are: \"primary\", \"secondary\", \"success\", \"danger\", \"warning\", \"info\", \"light\", \"dark\", \"striped\", \"hover\", \"active\", \"bordered\", \"borderless\", \"sm\", \"responsive\", \"responsive-sm\", \"responsive-md\", \"responsive-lg\", \"responsive-xl\", \"responsive-xxl\". For example, the following Markdown table will be rendered with row stripes and the rows will also be highlighted on hover:\n| fruit  | price  |\n|--------|--------|\n| apple  | 2.05   |\n| pear   | 1.37   |\n| orange | 3.09   |\n\n: Fruit prices {.striped .hover}\n\n\nEmbedded Markdown content can be specified\nIn addition, Quarto now supports the specification of embedded Markdown content in tables. This is done by providing a data attribute qmd or qmd-base64 in an embedded span or div node. These nodes can appear anywhere that such content is allowed: table headers, footers, cells, captions, etc. For example, consider the following table:\n<table>\n  <caption><span data-qmd=\"As described in @Lovelace1864, computers are great.\"></span></caption>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th><span data-qmd=\"_Header 1_\"></span></th>\n      <th><span data-qmd=\"_Header 2_\"></span></th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td><span data-qmd=\"\"></span></td>\n      <td>Regular output</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\nThe span nodes with the data-qmd attribute will be processed as embedded Markdown content. This allows you to embed arbitrary Markdown content in your tables, including citations, videos, etc. One thing to keep in mind is that the content of data-qmd needs to be escaped properly. Authors of libraries which generate table outputs should consider using the data-qmd-base64 attribute, which will be decoded and then processed by Quarto."

    "text": "Custom Formats\nYou can create highly customized output with Typst by defining a new format based on a custom Typst template. The Typst team has created several useful templates, a few which which have been adapted for use with Quarto as custom formats. These formats include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormat\nUsage\n\n\n\n\nLetter\nquarto use template quarto-ext/typst-templates/letter\n\n\nIEEE\nquarto use template quarto-ext/typst-templates/ieee\n\n\nFiction\nquarto use template quarto-ext/typst-templates/fiction\n\n\n\nThe source code for these formats is available at https://github.com/quarto-ext/typst-templates.\nTo create a new custom Typst format (or package an existing Typst template for use with Quarto) use the quarto create command to get started:\n\n\nTerminal\n\n$ quarto create extension format\n\nThen, choose typst as the base format and provide a name for the extension (e.g. letter). A sample Typst format extension will be created based on the code used in the default template that ships with Quarto. It will include the following files which you can edit to implement your custom format:\nTo implement the custom format, edit the following files:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n_extension.yml\nBasic extension metadata (name, author, description, etc.) and format definition.\n\n\nREADME.md\nDocumentation on how to install and use the format.\n\n\ntemplate.qmd\nA starter document that demonstrates the basics of the format.\n\n\ntypst-template.typ\nThe core Typst template function (documentation on creating Typst templates can be found here: https://typst.app/docs/tutorial/making-a-template/).\n\n\ntypst-show.typ\nFile that calls the template’s function (mapping Pandoc metadata to function arguments).\n\n\n\nAdditional resources you might find useful when creating custom formats include:\n\nThe official Typst tutorial on Making a Template\nList of third party templates from the Awesome Quarto repo.\n\n\nTemplate Partials\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis section covers advanced customization of Typst format output and can be safely ignored unless you have found the method of defining custom Typst formats described above too limited.\n\n\nAbove we describe a method of creating a Typst format based on specifying two template partials (typst-template.typ and typst-show.typ). These partials customize components of the default Typst Pandoc template, but leave some of the core scaffolding including definitions required by Pandoc for its Typst output as well as handling of bibliographies and footnotes (this means that your own custom Typst formats do not need to explicitly handle them).\nIf you would like to fully override the Pandoc template used for rendering Typst, use the template option in your custom format (rather than template-partials) and provide an alternate implementation of the default template. For example, your _extensions.yml might look like this:\n\n\n_extensions.yml\n\n---\ntitle: Typst Custom Format\nauthor: Jane Smith\nversion: \"0.2.0\"\nquarto-required: \">=1.4.11\"\ncontributes:\n  formats:\n    typst:\n      template: template.typ\n      template-partials:\n        - typst-template.typ\n        - typst-show.typ\n---\n\nUse the source codeof the default template as a starting point for your template.typ. Note that you can call all of the template partials provided by Quarto (e.g. biblio.typ() or notes.typ() from within your custom template implementation."

You can toggle between normal and tight lists using the ⌥⌘ 9 keyboard shortcut. You can also change the list type using the Format -> Edit Attributes dialog (also accessible via the F4 shortcut).

    "section": "CSS Styles",
    "text": "CSS Styles\nOne of the benefits of authoring with markdown is that your content can be easily published to a wide variety of formats. This is possible in significant measure because of the limitations that markdown imposes: you author in terms of the structure and semantics of your content, rather than worrying about specifically how things will appear.\nSometimes however you know that you’ll be publishing to HTML, and you want to exert more control over how things look. In this case, you can use CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) along with markdown to do custom formatting. This section covers how to:\n\nDefine CSS styles for your document; and\nApply those styles to entities within your document.\n\nIf you are new to CSS, you may want to brush up on the basics before proceeding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCSS styles apply only to HTML output, and will not have any impact on the formatting of other output types like PDF or MS Word.\n\n\n\n\nDefining Styles\nThe best way to include CSS styles is to create an external stylesheet (e.g. styles.css), then include it within the output options of your document. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"CSS Demo\"\nformat:\n  html:\n    css: styles.css\n---\nThe styles.css file might look something like this:\n.important {\n  color: maroon;\n}\n\n.illustration {\n  border: 1px solid rgb(230, 230, 230); \n}\nNote that it’s also possible to define styles inline with a CSS code chunk, but we recommend using an external file for easier manageability.\nWithin a markdown document you can apply one or more CSS classes to various document entities including headings, images, divs, and spans. CSS classes are applied using pandoc attributes. Once you’ve applied a class to an entity, it will derive its formatting from the CSS properties of the specified class.\n\n\nHeadings\nTo add a CSS class to a heading, use the edit button at the top right of the heading that appears when your cursor is within it (or use the F4 keyboard shortcut):\n\nNote the presence of the .important class within the Edit Attributes dialog.\nCSS classes applied to headings affect all content beneath the heading (an HTML <section> tag is wrapped around the content by Pandoc), so heading classes are a great way to provide custom styles for entire sections of your document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the visual editor doesn’t currently render content using styles applied through CSS classes so you won’t see the custom formatting while editing. You will however see it when rendering and previewing the HTML version of the document.\n\n\n\n\n\nImages\nYou can apply CSS classes to images (for example, to give them a special border) using the standard Image dialog. To do this, double-click the image (or use the F4 shortcut with the image selected) and apply the desired classes:\n\nNote again that the visual editor won’t display your image with the applied CSS classes while editing, however when actually rendering the document to HTML you’ll see the styles reflected.\n\n\nDivs\nDivs are special entities that allow you to apply identifiers and/or styles to a region of a document. Divs are block elements (like paragraphs).\nYou can create divs using the Insert -> Div command, and you can apply attributes (including CSS classes) to divs the same way as you apply attributes to headings (clicking the edit button or using the F4 keyboard shortcut when you are within a div):\n\nNote the presence of the .important class within the Div Attributes dialog.\n\n\nSpans\nSpans are special entities that allow you to apply identifiers and/or styles to a region of text. Spans are inline formatting marks (like bold or italic).\nSpans can be created by selecting text and using the Format -> Span command:\n\nHere we’ve applied a span to the text “customize PDF reports” and we’ve used the span to apply the .important CSS class. Note that as with headings and images the formatting is not displayed in the visual editor, but will be visible when the document is rendered."

This matches the behavior of markdown source editing mode within RStudio.\nHowever, if you prefer to insert line breaks at a particular column (e.g. 72 or 80), or to insert a line break after each sentence, you can set a global or per-project editor option to this effect.\nYou can also set this behavior on a per-document basis via the wrap option. For example, to wrap lines after 72 characters you would use this:\n---\neditor:\n  markdown:\n    wrap: 72\n---\nTo insert a line break after each sentence, use wrap: sentence. For example:\n---\neditor:\n  markdown:\n    wrap: sentence\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe algorithm used for sentence wrapping will handle English and Japanese text well, but may not detect the end of sentences accurately for other languages.\n\n\n\nIf you have enabled a global line wrapping option and want to turn off wrapping for a given document, use wrap: none.\n\n\nReferences\nBy default, references are written at the end of the block where their corresponding footnote appears. You can override this behavior using the references option.\nFor example, to write references at the end of sections rather than blocks you would use:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\neditor:\n  markdown:\n    references: \n      location: block\n---\nValid values for the references option are block, section, and document.\nNote that you can also set a global or per-project editor option to control reference writing behavior.\nIf you are aggregating a set of markdown documents into a larger work, you may want to make sure that reference identifiers are unique across all of your documents (e.g. you don’t want to have [^1] appear multiple times). You can ensure uniqueness via the prefix option. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\neditor:\n  markdown:\n    references: \n      location: block\n      prefix: \"mydoc\"\n---\nThis will result in footnotes in this document using the specified prefix (e.g. [^mydoc-1]), ensuring they are globally unique across the manuscript.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that if you are within a Quarto book project then a references prefix is applied automatically so no changes to editor: markdown are required.\n\n\n\n\n\nCanonical Mode\nIf you have a workflow that involves editing in both visual and source mode, you may want to ensure that the same markdown is written no matter which mode edits originate from. You can accomplish this using the canonical option. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\neditor:\n  markdown:\n    wrap: 72\n    references: \n      location: block\n    canonical: true\n---\nWith canonical: true, edits in visual mode and source mode will result in identical markdown output. This is especially useful if you have multiple authors collaborating using version control, with a mixture of source and visual mode editing among the authors."

Citations can be inserted from a variety of sources:\n\nYour document bibliography.\nZotero personal or group libraries.\nDOI (Document Object Identifier) references.\nSearches of Crossref, DataCite, or PubMed.\n\nIf you insert citations from Zotero, DOI look-up, or a search then they are automatically added to your document bibliography.\n\nBibliographies\nPandoc supports bibliographies in a wide variety of formats including BibTeX and CSL. Add a bibliography to your document using the bibliography YAML metadata field. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nbibliography: references.bib\nlink-citations: true\n---\nNote that we’ve also specified the link-citations option, which will make your citations hyperlinks to the corresponding bibliography entries.\nSee the Pandoc Citations documentation for additional information on bibliography formats.\n\n\nInserting Citations\nYou insert citations by either using the Insert -> Citation command or by using markdown syntax directly (e.g. [@cite] or @cite) .\nCitations go inside square brackets and are separated by semicolons. Each citation must have a key, composed of ‘@’ + the citation identifier from the database, and may optionally have a prefix, a locator, and a suffix. The citation key must begin with a letter, digit, or _, and may contain alphanumerics, _, and internal punctuation characters (:.#$%&-+?<>~/). Here are some examples:\n\n  \n    Blah Blah [see @doe99, pp. 33-35; also @smith04, chap. 1].\n  \n\n\n  Blah Blah [@doe99, pp. 33-35, 38-39 and passim].\n  \n\n\n  Blah Blah [@smith04;\n  @doe99].\n\n  Smith says blah [-@smith04].\n  \n\nYou can also write in-text citations, as follows:\n\n  \n    @smith04 says blah.\n  \n  \n    @smith04 [p. 33] says blah.\n  \n\nSee the Pandoc Citations documentation for additional information on citation syntax.\nUse the  toolbar button or the ⇧⌘ F8 keyboard shortcut to show the Insert Citation dialog:\n\nNote that you can insert multiple citations by using the add button on the right side of the item display.\n\nMarkdown Syntax\nYou can also insert citations directly using markdown syntax (e.g. [@cite]). When you do this a completion interface is provided for searching available citations:\n\n\n\nCitation IDs\nBefore inserting a citation from an external source you may wish to customize its ID. Within the Insert Citation dialog, click the edit button on the right side of citations to change their ID:\n\nIf you insert a new citation via code completion, you will also be provided with the opportunity to change its default citation ID.\nFor citations inserted from Zotero, you can also use the Better BibTeX plugin to generate citation IDs (this can be enabled via Citation Options if you have Better BibTeX installed).\n\n\nCitation Preview\nOnce you’ve inserted a citation, place the cursor over it to see a preview of it along with a link to the source if one is available:\n\n\n\n\nCitations from DOIs\nUse the From DOI pane of the Insert Citation dialog to insert a citation based on a DOI (e.g. that you have retrieved from a PubMed or other search):\n\nIf you are using markdown syntax, you can also paste a DOI after the [@ and it will be looked up:\n\nOnce you’ve confirmed that it’s the correct work (and possibly modified the suggested ID), the citation will be inserted into the document and an entry for the work added to your bibliography.\n\n\nCitations from Search\nUse the Crossref, DataCite, and PubMed panes of the Insert Citation dialog to search one of those services for a citation:\n\nItems inserted from a search will automatically be added to your bibliography.\nNote that for PubMed queries you can use the full supported query syntax. For example, this query searches on the author and title fields: Peterson[Author] AND Embolism[Title]. You can learn more about building PubMed queries here: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/advanced/.\n\n\nCitations from Zotero\nZotero is a popular free and open source reference manager. If you use Zotero, you can also insert citations directly from your Zotero libraries. If you have Zotero installed locally its location will be detected automatically and citations from your main library (My Library) will be available:\n\nZotero references will also show up automatically in completions:\n\nItems from Zotero will appear alongside items from your bibliography with a small “Z” logo juxtaposed over them. If you insert a citation from Zotero that isn’t already in your bibliography then it will be automatically added to the bibliography.\nIf you are running both RStudio and Zotero on your desktop, then no additional configuration is required for connecting to your Zotero library. If however you using RStudio Server and/or want to access your Zotero library over the web, then a few more steps are required (see the Zotero Web API section for details).\n\nGroup Libraries\nZotero Groups provide a powerful way to share collections with a class or work closely with colleagues on a project. By default, Zotero Group Libraries are not included in the Insert Citation dialog or citation completions. However, there are options available to use group libraries at a global, per-project, or per-document level.\nFor example, here we specify a project-level option to use the Reproducible Research Series (Year 1) group library:\n\nYou can also specify one or more libraries within YAML. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"Reproducible Research\"\nzotero: \"Reproducible Research Series (Year 1)\"\n---\nNote that you can also turn off Zotero entirely for a document using zotero: false:\n---\ntitle: \"Reproducible Research\"\nzotero: false\n---\n\n\nZotero Web API\nIf you are using RStudio Server and/or don’t have Zotero installed locally, you can still access your Zotero library using the Zotero Web API (assuming you have a Zotero web account and have synced your libraries to your account).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are running RStudio Desktop, it’s generally easier to also run Zotero on your desktop and access your library locally. That said, it is possible to access Zotero web libraries from RStudio Desktop if you prefer that configuration.\n\n\n\n\nAPI Access Key\nRStudio accesses Zotero web libraries using the Zotero Web API, so the first step is to create a Zotero account and then configure Zotero to sync its data to your account. You can do this using the Sync tab of the Zotero preferences:\n\nOnce you’ve configured your library to sync, you need to create a Zotero API Key to use with RStudio:\n\nFollow the instructions to create a new access key. Note that if you want to use Group Libraries with RStudio that you should change the default to provide read-only access to groups (as illustrated above).\nBe sure to record your key after generating it (i.e. copy it to the clipboard and/or save it somewhere more permanent) as you won’t be able to view it again after you navigate away.\nFinally, go to the R Markdown -> Citations preferences to connect Zotero to RStudio using your key:\n\nSet the Zotero Library option to “Web”, then paste in your Zotero Web API Key. You can use Verify Key… button to confirm that your Zotero API key is working correctly.\nOnce you’ve confirmed your connection you are ready to start inserting citations from Zotero."

    "text": "Zotero Citations\nZotero is a popular free and open source reference manager. The Quarto visual editor integrates directly with Zotero, enabling you to use the Insert Citation command to use references from your Zotero libraries:\n\nZotero references will also show up automatically in visual editor completions:\n\nItems from Zotero will appear alongside items from your bibliography with a small “Z” logo juxtaposed over them. If you insert a citation from Zotero that isn’t already in your bibliography then it will be automatically added to the bibliography.\n\nZotero Setup\nZotero integration uses the Zotero Web API, so the first step is to create a Zotero account and then configure Zotero to sync its data to your account. You can do this using the Sync tab of the Zotero preferences:\n\nOnce you’ve configured your library to sync, you need to create a Zotero API Key:\n\nFollow the instructions to create a new access key. Note that if you want to use Group Libraries, you should change the default to provide read-only access to groups (as illustrated above).\nBe sure to record your key after generating it (i.e. copy it to the clipboard and/or save it somewhere more permanent) as you won’t be able to view it again after you navigate away.\nFinally, execute the Quarto: Zotero - Sync Web Library command to connect VS Code with your Zotero web libraries:\n\nAfter you provide your API key and it is validated, an initial sync of your Zotero libraries is performed. After this, you are ready to start inserting citations from Zotero.\n\n\nGroup Libraries\nZotero Groups provide a powerful way to share collections with a class or work closely with colleagues on a project. By default, Zotero Group Libraries are not included in the Insert Citation dialog or citation completions. However, you can use the Quarto > Zotero: Group Libraries option to activate one or more group libraries (either globally, or per-workspace):\n\nAfter you’ve added a group library to the list, a sync will be peformed and you should see the library in the Insert Citation dialog. If you don’t, double check the exact spelling of the group library name you are configuring (you may even want to copy and paste it from Zotero so you are certain to get it right)."

    "section": "Markdown Output",
    "text": "Markdown Output\nThe Quarto visual editor generates markdown using Pandoc. This means that in some cases your markdown will be rewritten to conform to standard Pandoc idioms. For example, Pandoc inserts 3 spaces after list bullets and automatically escapes characters that might be used for markdown syntax.\nHere is a list of conventions for Pandoc generated markdown that might differ from your own markdown writing style:\n\n*text* is used in preference to _text_\nBacktick code blocks are written as ``` {.md} rather than ```md\nBacktick code blocks with no attributes are rendered as 4-space indented code blocks\nHorizontal rules are written as dashes spanning the full width of the document\nPlain links are written as <https://yihui.org> rather than https://yihui.org\nBullet and numbered lists use additional leading spaces before list item content\nThe blockquote character (>) is included on each new line of a blockquote\nTable captions are written below rather than above tables\nMultiline HTML and TeX blocks use the explicit raw attribute (e.g. ```{=tex})\nInline footnotes are replaced with footnotes immediately below the paragraph\nNested divs use ::: at all levels so long as their attributes are distinct\nUnnumbered sections are designated with {.unnumbered} rather than {-}\nCharacters used for markdown syntax (e.g. *, _, or #) are always escaped\n\nWhile some of this behavior might be bothersome at first, if you decide that visual editing mode is useful for your workflow it’s probably best to just adapt to writing your own markdown the same way that Pandoc does.\n\nWriter Options\nSome aspects of markdown output can be customized via global, project, or file-level options, including:\n\nHow to wrap / break lines (fixed column, sentence-per-line, etc.).\nWhere to write footnotes (below the current paragraph or section, or at the end of the document).\nWheter to write inline or reference style links.\n\nYou can specify these options in one of two ways:\n\nAs a global or per-workspace VS Code option (you can find the options that affect markdown output by filtering on quarto.visualEditor.markdown).\nSpecifying them within document or project level YAML (described below).\n\n\nLine Wrapping\nBy default, the visual editor writes Markdown with no line wrapping (paragraphs all occupy a single line). However, if you prefer to insert line breaks at a particular column (e.g. 72 or 80), or to insert a line break after each sentence, you can use the quarto.visualEditor.markdownWrap and quarto.visualEditor.markdownWrapColumn options accessible from the settings editor in VS Code.\nYou can also set this behavior on a per-document or per-project basis via the wrap option. For example, to wrap lines after 72 characters you would use this:\n---\neditor:\n  markdown:\n    wrap: 72\n---\nTo insert a line break after each sentence, use wrap: sentence. For example:\n---\neditor:\n  markdown:\n    wrap: sentence\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe algorithm used for sentence wrapping will handle English and Japanese text well, but may not detect the end of sentences accurately for other languages.\n\n\n\nIf you have enabled a global line wrapping option and want to turn off wrapping for a given document, use wrap: none.\n\n\nReferences\nBy default, references (footnotes and reference links) are written at the end of the block where their corresponding footnote appears. You can override this behavior using the quarto.visualEditor.markdownReferences VS Code setting or by using the references option within document or project YAML.\nFor example, to write references at the end of sections rather than blocks you would use:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\neditor:\n  markdown:\n    references: \n      location: block\n---\nValid values for the references option are block, section, and document.\nIf you are aggregating a set of markdown documents into a larger work, you may want to make sure that reference identifiers are unique across all of your documents (e.g. you don’t want to have [^1] appear multiple times). You can ensure uniqueness via the prefix option. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\neditor:\n  markdown:\n    references: \n      location: block\n      prefix: \"mydoc\"\n---\nThis will result in footnotes in this document using the specified prefix (e.g. [^mydoc-1]), ensuring they are globally unique across the manuscript.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that if you are within a Quarto book project then a references prefix is applied automatically so no changes to editor options are required.\n\n\n\n\n\nLinks\nLinks are written inline by default, however they can be written as reference links (below content as with footnotes) by adding the links: true option to the references section of document or project YAML. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\neditor:\n  markdown:\n    references: \n      location: block\n      links: true\n---\nYou can alternatively enable reference links using the VS Code quarto.visualEditor.markdownReferenceLinks option.\n\n\n\nKnown Limitations\nThere are a handful of Pandoc markdown extensions not currently supported by visual editing. These are infrequently used extensions, so in all likelihood they won’t affect documents you edit, but are still worth noting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtension(s)\nExample\nBehavior\n\n\n\n\nInline footnotes\n^[inline]\nConverted to numeric footnote.\n\n\nFootnote identifiers\n[^longnote]\nConverted to numeric footnote.\n\n\nExample lists\n(@) First example\nRead/written as ordinary numbered lists.\n\n\nAuto-list numbers\n#. First item\nRead/written as ordinary numbered lists.\n\n\nReference links\nThis is a [link]\nConverted to ordinary links.\n\n\nMultiMarkdown attributes\n# Heading [id]\nConverted to Pandoc attributes.\n\n\n\nThe visual editor is unable to parse non-YAML title blocks (e.g. old-style % titles or MultiMarkdown titles) and also unable to parse non top-level YAML metadata blocks. If these forms of metadata are encountered, visual mode will fail to load with a warning.\nNote that support for reference links can be enabled via the editor: markdown: references: links option in document or project YAML, or the VS Code quarto.visualEditor.markdownReferenceLinks option. Reference links will be written according the reference location option (either the block or section in which they appear, or alternatively at the end of the document)."

    "text": "Page Layout\nBy default Quarto HTML documents display content centered at a width optimized for readability (typically from 600px to 900px wide). While this is a sound default layout for traditional articles, for other types of pages (e.g. landing or index pages) you may want to use other layouts.\nThe page-layout option can be use to control the layout used. For example:\nformat: \n  html:\n    page-layout: full\nThe various page-layout options are described below.\n\nArticle\npage-layout: article\nArticle layout provides a content area with a page based grid layout that provides margins, areas for sidebars, and a reading width optimized body region. The precise size of the document regions will vary slightly depending upon the sidebar (if present) and the presence or absence of margin or complex layout elements. To learn more, checkout the guide to Article Layout.\n\n\nFull\npage-layout: full\nFull layout uses the article grid system, but automatically expands the content area to use the sidebar and margin region if no content is placed within those regions. This is useful for layouts that don’t need to be constrained to reading width and that will benefit from additional horizontal space (e.g. landing or index pages)\n\n\nCustom\npage-layout: custom\nCustom layout provides a simple HTML content container with no default grid system, padding, or margins. The default HTML framing provided will look this this:\n<div class=\"page-layout-custom\">\n  <!-- body content here -->\n</div>\nIn websites, custom layouts do not include navigation sidebars but do include the site navbar and footer.\n\nCSS Grid\nIf you are using page-layout: custom, you’ll likely want to utilize the Bootstrap CSS Grid layout system (which is available by default in Quarto documents) for creating more sophisticated layouts.\nFor example, here’s a simple 2-column grid:\n::: {.grid}\n\n::: {.g-col-4}\nThis column takes 1/3 of the page\n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-8}\nThis column takes 2/3 of the page\n:::\n\n:::\nBootstrap’s CSS Grid system includes facilities for responsiveness, wrapping, nesting, and fine grained customization of column behavior.\nNote that this isn’t the traditional Bootstrap grid used in older versions of Bootstrap – rather, it’s a brand new layout system introduced in Bootstrap 5.1 based on the CSS Grid standard. Quarto uses this newer system because it has more sophisticated layout capabilities akin to what LaTeX offers for print documents.\nSee the Bootstrap CSS Grid documentation for additionals details."

For example, if long entries in a sidebar are being wrapped, it may make sense to increase the width of sidebar:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault Layout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWider Sidebar\n\n\n\n\n\nThis change can be made by adding the grid option to the _quarto.yml file, increasing the sidebar-width from its default of 250px:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    grid:\n      sidebar-width: 350px\n\nThere are four variables to control the four components of the layout: the sidebar, the body, the margin, and the gutters.\nThe rest of this section describes these components, and their default values, as well as how to customize them either with YAML or SCSS variables. You can also find Additional Examples of customization in action.\n\nHTML Page Layout\nQuarto HTML documents are arranged in a structure composed of a sidebar on the left, the body of the document, the margin of the document on the right, and the space between these elements, known as gutters. This is illustrated below:\n\nThe width of these four components is controlled by four variables. These variables, along with their default values are:\n\n\nDefault values for the width of layout components\n\n\nElement\nSize\n\n\n\n\nsidebar-width\n250px\n\n\nbody-width\n800px\n\n\nmargin-width\n250px\n\n\ngutter-width\n1.5em\n\n\n\n\nThe values of these variables don’t directly specify the display width of the corresponding component, instead they specify a maximum base value. The maximum values are scaled to create minimum values, and together they are used to compute the size and position of each component across different layout types (fixed vs. floating), responsive sizes (large screen vs. mobile size), and page contents (margin vs. no margin content).\n\n\nCustomizing Component Widths\nYou can control the component width variables using YAML or SCSS variables. To set these options in YAML, you may use the grid option :\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nformat:\n  html: \n    grid:\n      sidebar-width: 300px\n      body-width: 900px\n      margin-width: 300px\n      gutter-width: 1.5rem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWebsites vs. Standalone HTML Pages\n\n\n\nCustomizing the layout of pages that are part of a Quarto website with YAML should happen at the site level in _quarto.yml. For HTML documents that aren’t part of a website, these options could also be set in the YAML at the top of the document.\n\n\nSimilarly, in a custom theme scss file, you may set variables like:\n// The left hand sidebar\n$grid-sidebar-width: 300px !default;\n\n// The main body\n$grid-body-width: 900px !default;\n\n// The right hand margin bar\n$grid-margin-width: 300px !default;\n\n// The gutter that appears between the above columns\n$grid-column-gutter-width: 1.5rem !default;\nsidebar-width, body-width, and margin-width should be specified in pixels (px) as the values will be used when computing other sizes. Requiring pixel sizing is a limitation of our approach to the Quarto’s layout, but also typically makes sense since the overall document width is usually tied to the browser size and responsive breakpoints rather than font size or other relative measures.\ngutter-width may be specified in pixels or other units such as em or rem which are responsive to the document font size.\n\n\nAdditional Examples\nIncreasing the margin width may make sense on a website that has many figures or tables in the margin. For example, this YAML increases the margin-width by 200px over the default value:\nformat:\n  html:\n    grid:\n      margin-width: 450px\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault Layout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWider Margin\n\n\n\n\n\nThe effect of changing margin-width without changing body-width is to increase the overall page width (there is less white space on the far left and right of the page). Alternatively, to keep the overall page width the same body-width can be decreased by the same amount as margin-width increased:\nformat:\n  html:\n    grid:\n      margin-width: 450px\n      body-width: 600px\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault Layout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWider Margin, Narrower Body"

We actively encourage Quarto-based open source projects and businesses—our goal with this policy is to prevent confusion about the source of Quarto related software and services."
