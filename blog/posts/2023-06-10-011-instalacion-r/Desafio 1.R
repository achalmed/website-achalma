# Create the vectors "x" "y" "year" and "names"

x <- c(2,3,7,9)
y <- c(9,7,3,2)
year <- 1990:1993
names <- c("payal", "shraddha", "kritika", "itida")

#----
# Task 1: Working with vectors
#----

# Print out the vectors "x" and "y" on the console

# Check the number of elements in "x" and "y"

# Multiply the elements in vector "x" by 21

# Multiply vector "x" by vector "y"

# Combine vectors "x" and "y"

# Combine vectors "x" and names

# What did happen? What is the type of the vector names?

#----
# Task 2: Working with matrices
#----

# Create a matrix named "A" by combining the vectors "x", "y" and "year" columnwise together

# Create a 2 x 2 matrix named "B" consisting of elements in vector "x"

# Create a 2 x 2 matrix named "D" consisting of elements in vector "names"

# Combine matrices "B" and "D"

# What went wrong?

# Create a new matrix "E" consisting of elements in vector "y". Multiply the matrices "B" and "E".

# Multiply the matrices "B" and "E" by using matrix multiplication.

#----
# Task 3: Data frames
#----

# Create a data frame by combining vectors the vectors "x" "y" "year" and "names"

# What is the number of columns in the data frame?

# What is the number of rows in the data frame?

# Can you obtain the same information by using the dim()-function?

#----
# Task 4: Creating data objects
#----

# Generate a vector with elements consisting of integer values from 1 to 10. 
# Hint: An example was given in the lecture.

# Generate a vector with elements consisting of numeric values from 1 to 10 using the seq()-function.
# The sequence function is defined as seq(from, to, by)

# What is the data type of this vector?

# Generate a vector including the element 3 for 10 times using the rep()-function. 
# The replicates function is defined as rep(x, times).

# What is the data type of this vector?

# Replicate vector "x" from above for 3 times.

# Generate a 5 x 4 matrix including integer values from 1 to 20.
