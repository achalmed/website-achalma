## Overview

HTML pages rendered with Quarto include a formatted appendix at the end of the article. The appendix includes sections for citations and footnotes in the document, as well the attribution information (if specified) for the document itself.

A simple example document appendix looks like:

![](images/document-appendix-simple.png){.border fig-alt="Appendix with two sections: References, and Footnotes."}

To learn more about including document attribution information in the appendix, see [Creating Citeable Articles](/docs/authoring/create-citeable-articles.qmd).

## Custom Appendix Sections

Sections of your document can be added to the Appendix that appears at the end of your article by adding the `.appendix` class to any header. For example:

``` yaml
## Acknowledgments {.appendix}

I am grateful for the insightful comments offered by the anonymous peer reviewers at Books & Texts. The generosity and expertise of one and all have improved this study in innumerable ways and saved me from many errors; those that inevitably remain are entirely my own responsibility.
```

Any sections marked with the `.appendix` class will be included at the front of the appendix in the order in which they appear in the document. A more complete example appendix including attribution and the above custom appendix section looks like:

![](images/document-appendix-full.png){.border fig-alt="Appendix with Acknowledgements, References, Footnes, and Citation sections. The Citation section contains both BibTex citation, and plain text for attribution."}

## License

If you include a license in the front matter or citation information for your document, a 'Reuse' section will automatically be added to the appendix. You can specify either a Creative Commons license, for example:

``` yaml
license: "CC BY"
```

or any other license message, for example:

``` yaml
license: "Copyright Acme, Inc. 2021. All Rights Reserved"
```

### Creative Commons

The Creative Commons copyright licenses and tools forge a balance inside the traditional "all rights reserved" setting that copyright law creates. These tools give everyone from individual creators to large companies and institutions a simple, standardized way to grant copyright permissions to their creative work.

Here are some of the common forms of Creative Commons content license:

| License    | Name                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `CC BY`    | Attribution               | This license lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation. This is the most accommodating of licenses offered.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `CC BY-SA` | Attribution-ShareAlike    | This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work even for commercial purposes, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms. This license is often compared to "copyleft" free and open source software licenses. All new works based on yours will carry the same license, so any derivatives will also allow commercial use. |
| `CC BY-ND` | Attribution-NoDerivs      | This license allows for redistribution, commercial and non-commercial, as long as it is passed along unchanged and in whole, with credit to you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `CC BY-NC` | Attribution-NonCommercial | This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work non-commercially, and although their new works must also acknowledge you and be non-commercial, they don't have to license their derivative works on the same terms.                                                                                                                                                  |

If you specify a Creative Commons license for your content, Quarto will automatically include the relevant link to the appropriate license in the re-use section.

### Other Licenses

If you include a non Creative Commons license (or other text) in the license options, that content will be included verbatim in the 'Reuse' section of the document appendix.

Here is an example of a complete appendix including all the fields with an Attribution-ShareAlike Creative Commons license.

![](images/document-appendix-reuse.png){.border fig-alt="Appendix with Acknowledgements, References, Footnotes, Reuse, and Citation sections. The Reuse section contains a link to the Attribution-ShareAlike Creative Commons license."}

## Appendix Style

You can control how Quarto process the appendix of your document using the `appendix-style` option. There are three options available:

`default`

:   The default appendix treatment create a smaller font face and gathers the various sections into stylized groups at the end of the document.

`plain`

:   The plain treatment will do all the appendix processing (gathering and organizing the sections at the end of the document, creating sections like 'Reuse'), but will not apply the default appendix styling.

`none`

:   `none` disables appendix processing altogether. Content will not be processed or organized and information like 'Citation' and 'Reuse' will not be included in the document.
