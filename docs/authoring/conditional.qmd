In some cases you may want to create content that only displays for a given output format (or only displays when *not* rendering to a format). You can accomplish this by creating divs with the `.content-visible` and `.content-hidden` classes.

## .content-visible

To make content visible only for a given format, create a div (`:::`) with the `.content-visible` class. For example, here we mark content as only visible in HTML:

``` markdown
::: {.content-visible when-format="html"}

Will only appear in HTML.

:::
```

You can also mark content as visible for all formats *except* a specified format. For example:

``` markdown
::: {.content-visible unless-format="pdf"}

Will not appear in PDF.

:::
```

Then `when-format` and `unless-format` attributes match the current Pandoc output format with some additional intelligence to alias related formats (e.g. html, html4, and html5). Details are provided below in [Format Matching](#format-matching)

## .content-hidden

To prevent content from being displayed when rendering to a given format, create a div (`:::`) with the `.content-hidden` class. For example, here we mark content as hidden in HTML:

``` markdown
::: {.content-hidden when-format="html"}

Will not appear in HTML.

:::
```

You can also mark content as hidden for all formats *except* a specified format. For example:

``` markdown
::: {.content-hidden unless-format="pdf"}

Will only appear in PDF.

:::
```

## Format Matching {#format-matching}

Then `when-format` and `unless-format` clauses do some aliasing of related formats to make it more straightforward to target content. The following aliases are implemented:
