## Citations

Quarto will use Pandoc to automatically generate citations and a bibliography in a number of styles. To use this capability, you will need:

-   A quarto document formatted with citations (see [Citation Markdown](#sec-citations)).

-   A bibliographic data source, for example a BibLaTeX (`.bib`) or BibTeX (`.bibtex`) file.

-   Optionally, a `CSL` file which specifies the formatting to use when generating the citations and bibliography (when not using `natbib` or `biblatex` to generate the bibliography).

### Bibliography Files

Quarto supports bibliography files in a wide variety of formats including BibLaTeX and CSL. Add a bibliography to your document using the `bibliography` YAML metadata field. For example:

``` yaml
---
title: "My Document"
bibliography: references.bib
---
```

::: callout-tip
You can provide more than one bibliography file if you would like by setting the `bibliography` field's value to a YAML array.

See the [Pandoc Citations](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citations) documentation for additional information on bibliography formats.

### Citation Syntax {#sec-citations}

Quarto uses the standard Pandoc markdown representation for citations (e.g. `[@citation]`) --- citations go inside square brackets and are separated by semicolons. Each citation must have a key, composed of '\@' + the citation identifier from the database, and may optionally have a prefix, a locator, and a suffix. The citation key must begin with a letter, digit, or `_`, and may contain alphanumerics, `_`, and internal punctuation characters (`:.#$%&-+?<>~/`). Here are some examples:

+-------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+

+-------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+

You can also write in-text citations, as follows:

+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Markdown Format                   | Output (author-date format)   | Output (numerical format)     |
+===================================+===============================+===============================+
|     @knuth1984 says blah.         | @knuth1984 says blah.         | [1] says blah.                |
+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
|     @knuth1984 [p. 33] says blah. | @knuth1984 [p. 33] says blah. | [1] [p. 33] says blah.        |
+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+

See the [Pandoc Citations](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citations) documentation for additional information on citation syntax.

### Citation Style

Quarto uses Pandoc to format citations and bibliographies. By default, Pandoc will use the [Chicago Manual of Style](https://chicagomanualofstyle.org/) author-date format, but you can specify a custom formatting using CSL ([Citation Style Language](https://citationstyles.org)). To provide a custom citation stylesheet, provide a path to a CSL file using the `csl` metadata field in your document, for example:

``` yaml
---
title: "My Document"
bibliography: references.bib
csl: nature.csl
---
```

You can find CSL files or learn more about using styles at the [CSL Project](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles). You can browse the list of more than 8,500 Creative Commons CSL definitions in the CSL Project's [central repository](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles) or Zotero's [style repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles).

`CSL` styling is only available when the `cite-method` is `citeproc` (which it is by default). If you are using another `cite-method`, you can control the formatting of the references using the mechanism provided by that method.

### Bibliography Generation

By default, Pandoc will automatically generate a list of works cited and place it in the document if the style calls for it. It will be placed in a div with the id `refs` if one exists:

``` markdown
### References

::: {#refs}
:::
```

If no such div is found, the works cited list will be placed at the end of the document. 

If your bibliography is being generated using BibLaTeX or natbib (@sec-biblatex), the bibliography will always appear at the end of the document and the `#refs` div will be ignored.

::: callout-tip
You can suppress generation of a bibliography by including `suppress-bibliography: true` option in your document metadata
:::

Here's an example of a generated bibliography:

::: {#refs}
:::

### Including Uncited Items

If you want to include items in the bibliography without actually citing them in the body text, you can define a dummy `nocite` metadata field and put the citations there:

    ---
    nocite: |
      @item1, @item2
    ---

    @item3

In this example, the document will contain a citation for `item3` only, but the bibliography will contain entries for `item1`, `item2`, and `item3`.

It is possible to create a bibliography with all the citations, whether or not they appear in the document, by using a wildcard:

    ---
    nocite: |
      @*
    ---

### Using BibLaTeX or natbib {#sec-biblatex}

## Footnotes

Pandoc supports numbering and formatting footnotes using the following syntax:

``` markdown
Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.

[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
belong to the previous footnote.

        { some.code }

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
    line.  In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like
    multi-paragraph list items.

This paragraph won't be part of the note, because it
isn't indented.
```

#### Output

Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^2]

This paragraph won't be part of the note, because it isn't indented.

In addition, you can also write single paragraph footnotes inline using the following syntax:

``` markdown
Here is an inline note.^[Inlines notes are easier to write,
since you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to
type the note.]
```

#### Output

Here is an inline note.[^3]

The footnotes that are generated from the above examples are included in the following section. See the [Pandoc Footnotes](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#footnotes) for additional information.

[^1]: Here is the footnote.

[^2]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they belong to the previous footnote.

        { some.code }

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first line. In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like multi-paragraph list items.

[^3]: Inlines notes are easier to write, since you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to type the note.
