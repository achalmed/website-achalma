Quarto includes a number of features aimed at making it easy to to author and customize markdown table output, including:

-   Specifying column alignment and widths.
-   Providing captions, subcaptions, and cross-references.
-   Generating tables dynamically from executable code cells.

This post provides an overview of these capabilities in Quarto. For more detail about all the features Quarto for authoring tables, see [Tables](/docs/authoring/tables.qmd).

## Markdown Tables

The most commonly used markdown table is known as a pipe table. Pipe tables support specifying per column alignment as well as captions. For example:

``` markdown
| Default | Left | Right | Center |
|---------|:-----|------:|:------:|
| 12      | 12   |    12 |   12   |
| 123     | 123  |   123 |  123   |
| 1       | 1    |     1 |   1    |

Here is the table rendered to HTML:

| Default | Left | Right | Center |
|---------|:-----|------:|:------:|
| 12      | 12   |    12 |   12   |
| 123     | 123  |   123 |  123   |
| 1       | 1    |     1 |   1    |

#### Caption Location

By default, table captions are positioned above tables. You can modify this behavior using the `tbl-cap-location` option. For example:

``` yaml
---
tbl-cap-location: top
---
```

## Explicit Column Widths

Beyond standard pipe table syntax for expressing column width, you can also explicitly specify columns widths using the `tbl-colwidths` attribute or document-level option. For an individual markdown table, add the attribute after the caption. For example:

``` markdown
| fruit  | price  |
|--------|--------:
| apple  | 2.05   |
| pear   | 1.37   |
| orange | 3.09   |

: Fruit prices {tbl-colwidths="[75,25]"}
```

Note that this option is specified at the top level so that it can be shared by both PDF and HTML formats. If you are only targeting a single format you can place it alongside other `format` specific options.

Valid values for the caption location include:

| Value    | Description                           |
|----------|---------------------------------------|
| `top`    | Position the caption above the table. |
| `bottom` | Position the caption below the table. |
| `margin` | Position the caption in the margin.   |

## Computations

All of the options described above work for tables produced by executable code cells. For example, here we apply the `tbl-cap`, `tbl-colwidths` and `tbl-caption-location` options to a code cell:

```{{r}}
#| tbl-cap: "Cars"
#| tbl-colwidths: [60,40]
#| tbl-cap-location: margin

library(knitr)
kable(head(cars))
```

In addition to the above, which focused on some of the features of Quarto when writing pipe tables in markdown, you can also author tables using grid syntax. You review the [documentation](/docs/authoring/tables.qmd). for more detail.
