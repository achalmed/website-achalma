## Escaping

If you are writing documentation about using variable shortcodes (for example, this article!) you might need to prevent them from being processed. You can do this in two ways:

1.  Escape the shortcode reference with extra braces like this:

    ``` {.default shortcodes="false"}
    {{{< var version >}}}
    ```

2.  Add a `shortcodes=false` attribute to any code block you want to prevent processing of shortcodes within:

    ```` default
    ```{{shortcodes=false}}
    {{{< var version >}}}
    ```
    ````
