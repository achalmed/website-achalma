## Learning More

You've now learned the basics of using Quarto! Once you feel comfortable creating and customizing documents here are a few more things to explore:

-   [Presentations](/docs/presentations/index.qmd) --- Author PowerPoint, Beamer, and Revealjs presentations using the same syntax you've learned for creating documents.

-   [Websites](/docs/websites/) --- Publish collections of documents as a website. Websites support multiple forms of navigation and full-text search.

-   [Blogs](/docs/websites/website-blog.qmd) --- Create a blog with an about page, flexible post listings, categories, RSS feeds, and over twenty themes.

-   [Books](/docs/books/) --- Create books and manuscripts in print (PDF, MS Word) and online (HTML, ePub) formats.

-   [Interactivity](/docs/interactive/) --- Include interactive components to help readers explore the concepts and data you are presenting more deeply.
