If you want to include additional content in your document from another file, you can use the `include-in-*` options:

| Option                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `include-in-header`   | Include contents of *file*, verbatim, at the end of the header. This can be used, for example, to include special CSS or JavaScript in HTML documents or to inject commands into the LaTeX preamble.                                     |
| `include-before-body` | Include contents of *file*, verbatim, at the beginning of the document body (e.g.Â after the `<body>` tag in HTML, or the `\begin{document}` command in LaTeX). This can be used to include navigation bars or banners in HTML documents. |
| `include-after-body`  | Include contents of *file*, verbatim, at the end of the document body (before the `</body>` tag in HTML, or the `\end{document}` command in LaTeX).                                                                                      |

You can specify a single file or multiple files for each of these options directly, or use the `file:` subkey. To include raw content in the YAML header, use the `text` subkey.  When using `text:`, add the `|` character after `text:` to indicate that the value is a multi-line string. If you omit `file:` or `text:`, Quarto assumes you are providing a file.
