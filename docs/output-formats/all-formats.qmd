## Overview

Pandoc supports a huge array of output formats, all of which can be used with Quarto. To use any Pandoc format just use the `format` option or the `--to` command line option.

For example, here's some YAML that specifies the use of the `html` format as well as a couple of format options:

``` yaml
---
title: "My Document"
format: 
  html:
    toc: true
    code-fold: true
---
```

Alternatively you can specify the use of a format on the command line:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto render document.qmd --to html
```

See below for a list of all output formats by type along with links to their reference documentation.
