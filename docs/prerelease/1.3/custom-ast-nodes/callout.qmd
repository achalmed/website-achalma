In Quarto 1.3, callouts are represented as a custom AST node. You can create callout AST nodes in Lua filters with the `quarto.Callout` constructor. The constructor takes a single parameter, a table with entries `type`, `title`, and `content`, as described below. In Lua filters, callouts are represented as a table with the following fields:

- `type`: the type of callout: `note`, `caution`, `warning`, etc (optional in the constructor).
- `title`: The callout title (if any) (optional in the constructor),
- `icon`: the callout icon (or `false` if none) (optional in the constructor)
- `appearance`: `"minimal"`, `"simple"`, or `"default"` (optional in the constructor)
- `collapse`: whether to render the callout as collapsible (optional in the constructor, default `false`)
- `content`: the content of the callout (a `pandoc.Blocks` object, or a plain list in the constructor)
