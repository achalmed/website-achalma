In Quarto 1.3, conditional blocks are represented as a custom AST node. You can create conditional block AST nodes in Lua filters with the `quarto.ConditionalBlock` constructor. The constructor takes a single parameter, a table with entries `node`, `behavior`, and `condition`, as described below.
In Lua filters, conditional blocks are represented as a table with the following fields:

- `node`: the div containing the content
- `behavior`: either `content-visible` or `content-hidden`
- `condition`: a list of 2-element lists, such as `{ { "unless-format", "html" } }` (optional in the constructor, default value `{}`). The first element of each sublist must be one of `when-format`, `unless-format`, `when-profile`, and `unless-profile`. The second element is the relevant format or profile.
