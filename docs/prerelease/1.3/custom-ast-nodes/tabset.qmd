In Quarto 1.3, tabsets are represented as a custom AST node. You can create conditional blocks in Lua filters with the `quarto.Tabset` constructor, with parameters `tabs`, `level` and `attr` as described above. In
addition, you can use `quarto.Tab` to create the tab objects for the `tabs` field. `quarto.Tab` is more lenient with parameter types, converting strings to `Blocks` and `Inlines` as needed. In Lua filters, tabsets are represented as a table with the following fields:

- `tabs`: a table containing the content for each tab. Each entry is a table with two entries: `title` (a `pandoc.Inlines`) and `content` (a `pandoc.Blocks`) (optional in the contructor, default value `{}`)
- `level`: the level of the tab headings to be used in rendering the tabset (optional in the constructor, default value `2`)
- `attr`: the `Attr` object for the resulting tabset div (optional in the constructor)
