## Overview

Quarto supports a variety of formats for creating presentations, including:

-   `revealjs` --- [reveal.js](revealjs/index.qmd) (HTML)

-   `pptx` --- [PowerPoint](powerpoint.qmd) (MS Office)

-   `beamer` --- [Beamer](beamer.qmd) (LaTeX/PDF)

There are pros and cons to each of these formats. The most capable format by far is `revealjs` so is highly recommended unless you have specific requirements for Office or LaTeX output. Note that `revealjs` presentations can be presented as HTML slides or can be printed to PDF for easier distribution.

Below we'll describe the basic syntax for presentations that applies to all formats. See the format specific articles for additional details on their native capabilities.
