## Overview

There are a wide variety of ways to publish documents, presentations, and websites created using Quarto. Since content rendered with Quarto uses standard formats (HTML, PDFs, MS Word, etc.) it can be published anywhere. Additionally, there is a `quarto publish` command available for easy publishing to various popular services (GitHub, Netlify, Posit Connect, etc.) as well as various tools to make it easy to publish from a Continuous Integration (CI) system.

## Getting Started

To get started, review the documentation for using one of the following publishing services:

| Destination                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                     |

If you don't know which to choose, try [Quarto Pub](quarto-pub.qmd) which is a free service for publicly available content. If you are publishing to a destination not listed above, choose [Other Services](other.qmd).

These articles cover both straightforward direct publishing as well as Continuous Integration (CI) publishing with GitHub Actions. If you want to publish using CI and aren't using GitHub Actions, the article on [Publishing with CI](ci.qmd) provides additional details and documentation.
