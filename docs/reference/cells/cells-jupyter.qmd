title: "Code Cells: Jupyter"
---

[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) is an open document format that supports computations in many languages including Python, R, and Julia. Learn more about using Jupyter with Quarto in the articles on [Using Python](../../computations/python.qmd) and [Using Julia](../../computations/julia.qmd).

## Overview

Cell options affect the execution and output of executable code blocks. They are specified within comments at the top of a block. For example:

```{{python}}
#| label: fig-polar
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "A line plot on a polar axis"
```
