[Knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/) is an R package for dynamic document generation. Learn more about using Knitr in the article on [Using R](../../computations/r.qmd).

## Overview

Cell options affect the execution and output of executable code blocks. They are specified within comments at the top of a block. For example:

``` {{r}}
#| label: fig-polar
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "A line plot on a polar axis"
```
