title: "Code Cells: Observable JS"
---

[Observable JS](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/observables-not-javascript) is a set of enhancements to vanilla JavaScript created by [Mike Bostock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Bostock) (also the author of [D3](https://d3js.org/)). Observable JS is distinguished by its [reactive runtime](https://github.com/observablehq/runtime), which is especially well suited for interactive data exploration and analysis.

Learn more about using Observable JS with Quarto in the articles on [Interactive Documents with Observable JS](../../interactive/ojs/index.qmd).

## Overview

Cell options affect the execution and output of executable code blocks. They are specified within comments at the top of a block. For example:

```{{ojs}}
//| label: fig-polar
//| echo: false
//| fig-cap: "A line plot on a polar axis"
```
