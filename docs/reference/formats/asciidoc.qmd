## Asciidoc vs Asciidoctor Format

Pandoc includes support for both the `asciidoc` and `asciidoctor` formats. The `asciidoc` format produces older style syntax that is no longer typically used, while the `asciidoctor` format produces the more current markdown syntax that is part of the formal AsciiDoc specification.

In Quarto, both `asciidoc` and `asciidoctor` are aliases for the `asciidoctor` format.
