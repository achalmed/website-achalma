reStructuredText is an easy-to-read, what-you-see-is-what-you-get plaintext markup syntax and parser system. It is useful for in-line program documentation (such as Python docstrings), for quickly creating simple web pages, and for standalone documents. You can learn more about reStructuredText at <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html>.
