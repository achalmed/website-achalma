This article documents options that define the type, render targets, and output of a project.

See the [Project Basics](../../projects/quarto-projects.qmd) article for additional documentation on using projects.

Project options are specified under the `project` key. For example:

``` yaml
---
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: _site
---
```

::: {#table-project}
:::

### Preview

``` yaml
---
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: _site
  preview:
    port: 4200
    browser: false
---
```

Available `preview` options include:
