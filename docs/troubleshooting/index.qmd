This page documents a number of strategies you can employ in case you run into problems with Quarto.
As always, we welcome feedback and bug reports on the [Quarto issue tracker](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues),
but this page might help you get up and running quickly.

## Basics

### Check the version of quarto and its dependencies
 
You can check the version of Quarto and its dependencies by running `quarto check`. Here's an example of the output it generates:

```
[✓] Checking versions of quarto binary dependencies...
      Pandoc version 2.19.2: OK
      Dart Sass version 1.32.8: OK
[✓] Checking versions of quarto dependencies......OK
[✓] Checking Quarto installation......OK
      Version: 1.2.313
      Path: /Users/cscheid/repos/github/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/package/dist/bin

[✓] Checking basic markdown render....OK

[✓] Checking Python 3 installation....OK
      Version: 3.10.9
      Path: /Users/cscheid/virtualenvs/homebrew-python3/bin/python3
      Jupyter: 5.1.3
      Kernels: python3, julia-1.6, julia-1.8

[✓] Checking Jupyter engine render....OK

[✓] Checking R installation...........OK
      Version: 4.2.2
      Path: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources
      LibPaths:
        - /Users/cscheid/repos/github/quarto-dev/quarto-web/renv/library/R-4.2/aarch64-apple-darwin20
        - /private/var/folders/nm/m64n9_z9307305n0xtzpp54m0000gn/T/RtmpXmQfZA/renv-system-library
      rmarkdown: 2.14

[✓] Checking Knitr engine render......OK
```

### Get a stack trace

Setting `QUARTO_PRINT_STACK=true` in your environment will cause Quarto to print a stack trace when an error occurs.

::: panel-tabset

## Windows

On PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:QUARTO_PRINT_STACK = "true"
```

## Unix

On bash-like shells:

```bash
export QUARTO_PRINT_STACK=true
```

:::

### Verbose mode

Quarto will print more information about its internal state if you set `QUARTO_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` in your environment.

### Inspect log files {#log-files}

Quarto creates log files that can help you diagnose problems. These are stored in different locations depending on your operating system:

::: panel-tabset

## Windows

`%LOCALAPPDATA%\quarto\logs`

## macOS

`${HOME}/Library/Application Support/quarto/logs`

## Linux

If `$XDG_DATA_HOME` is set, `${XDG_DATA_HOME}/.local/share/quarto/logs`, otherwise `${HOME}/.local/share/quarto/logs`

:::

### Out-of-memory issues

When building a large project or website, you might run into memory limits. In that case, consider the following environment variable.

In this example, we're setting the maximum amount of memory to be allocated by Deno to be 8GB. Adjust this to your computer's limits.

::: panel-tabset

## Windows

On PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:QUARTO_DENO_EXTRA_OPTIONS = "--v8-flags=--max-old-space-size=8192"
```

## Unix

On bash-like shells:

```bash
export QUARTO_DENO_EXTRA_OPTIONS=--v8-flags=--max-old-space-size=8192
```

:::

### Installer issues

::: panel-tabset

## macOS

In macOS, installers write their output to `/var/log/install.log`. Inspecting this file might offer hints to what went wrong.

::: callout-warning

If you're going to ask for help on public forums, be aware that *every* macOS installer writes to the same file `/var/log/install.log`. 
You should make sure you're not accidentally disclosing installation information you would rather not.

### PDF/LaTeX issues

If quarto finds an existing installation of `texlive` in your system, it will use that. If you're seeing
issues with rendering to PDF, make sure you have an up-to-date installation of `texlive`. Alternatively, you can have quarto use its own version, by calling `quarto install tinytex`.

## Environment, Libraries, and Dependencies

One common source of tricky problems is the presence of multiple installations of R and Python in a system. Quarto will attempt to find an R or Python installation, and sometimes your shell environment is pointing to a different one.

### knitr

If you suspect that quarto is finding the wrong version of an R installation, you can obtain information about the R installation that Quarto sees by running the following .qmd file:

````
---
engine: knitr
---

```{{r}}
sessionInfo()
Sys.getenv()
.libPaths()

# If the sessioninfo package is available, 
# it provides output that is easier to read,
# and can write its results to a file
sessioninfo:::session_info(to_file = "quarto-session-info-output.txt")
```
````

You can then also run those commands from your R environment, and compare the output. If `sessioninfo` is available, then you
can ask for a difference between the outputs more directly:

```r
sessioninfo:::session_diff(new = "quarto-session-info-output.txt")
```

## Advanced

### Debugging Jupyter engine issues

To enable Jupyter debugging, add the following to your YAML front matter:

```yml
execute:
  debug: true
```

Quarto creates a log of the execution of jupyter notebooks in its [log directory](#log-files) under `jupyter-kernel.log`.

If Jupyter execution is hanging instead of failing, you can force immediate flushing of the log by setting `QUARTO_JUPYTER_FLUSH_LOGS=true` in your environment before running quarto.

### Debugging Lua filters

#### Useful Lua helper functions

Quarto includes a number of useful Lua helper functions that can be used to debug Lua filters. These are available in the `quarto` module, and can be used as follows:

```lua
quarto.log.output(obj) -- prints a potentially complex object to the console
```

#### Filter tracing

Setting `QUARTO_TRACE_FILTERS=true` in your environment will cause Quarto to produce a trace of the Lua filters it runs. This will be a file written to the directory in which `quarto` runs, named `quarto-filter-trace.json`. We include an HTML page that can be used to visualize this trace, which you can find in the `quarto-cli` repository at [`package/src/common/trace-viewer/index.html`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/tree/main/package/src/common/trace-viewer/index.html). Open this page in your browser and provide the path to the JSON file as the URL parameter `file` (eg. `index.html?file=quarto-filter-trace.json`), and you'll see a report of the changes produced by each part of the filter chain.
