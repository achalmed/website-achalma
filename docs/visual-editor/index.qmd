## Overview

The Quarto visual editor provides a [WYSIWYM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYM) editing interface for all of Pandoc markdown, including tables, citations, cross-references, footnotes, divs/spans, definition lists, attributes, raw HTML/TeX, and more. The visual editor also includes support for executing code cells and viewing their output inline:

Underneath is a table containing R syntax, mathematical notation, and definitions for the semi- and anti-joins. Underneath this table is an R code chunk that displays a graphical representation of a semi-join."}

The visual editor doesn't attempt to abstract away or obscure the underlying markdown document. Rather, it aims to provide a highly productive writing interface for people that love markdown. You can also still use most markdown constructs (e.g., \## or **bold**) directly for formatting.

### Switching Modes

Markdown documents can be edited in either source or visual mode. To switch into visual mode for a given document, use the <kbd>Source</kbd> or <kbd>Visual</kbd> button at the top-left of the document toolbar (or alternatively the <kbd>⌘⇧ F4</kbd> keyboard shortcut):

Note that you can switch between source and visual mode at any time (editing location and undo/redo state will be preserved when you switch).

## Getting Started

The Quarto visual editor is currently available as a feature of the [RStudio IDE](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). The visual editor will eventually also be made available in standalone form.

To get started with the visual editor, download the latest release of RStudio ({{< var rstudio.current_release >}}) for your platform from:

<https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>

## Using the Editor

### Keyboard Shortcuts

There are keyboard shortcuts for all basic editing tasks. Visual mode supports both traditional keyboard shortcuts (e.g. <kbd>⌘ B</kbd> for bold) as well as markdown shortcuts (using markdown syntax directly). For example, enclose `**bold**` text in asterisks or type `##` and press space to create a second level heading. Here are some of the most commonly used shortcuts:

| Command      | Keyboard Shortcut | Markdown Shortcut |
|--------------|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|
| Bold         |  <kbd>⌘ B</kbd>   |    `**bold**`     |
| Italic       |  <kbd>⌘ I</kbd>   |    `*italic*`     |
| Code         |  <kbd>⌘ D</kbd>   |   `` `code` ``    |
| Heading 1    |  <kbd>⌥⌘ 1</kbd>  |        `#`        |
| Heading 2    |  <kbd>⌥⌘ 2</kbd>  |       `##`        |
| Heading 3    |  <kbd>⌥⌘ 3</kbd>  |       `###`       |
| Link         |   <kbd>⌘ K</kbd>  |     `<href>`      |
| R Code Chunk |  <kbd>⌥⌘ I</kbd>  | ```` ```{r} ````  |

See the [editing shortcuts](options.qmd#shortcuts) article for a complete list of all shortcuts.

### Insert Anything

You can also use the catch-all <kbd>⌘ /</kbd> shortcut to insert just about anything. Just execute the shortcut then type what you want to insert. For example:

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
![](images/visual-editing-omni-list.png){fig-alt="There is a line of text (with a cursor at the end) where someone has typed '/lis'. There is a drop-down menu underneath this with options for 'Bullet List', 'Numbered List', and 'Definition List' arranged vertically. The title of each item is bolded, has a small icon to the left, and a small description in lighter gray text underneath it."}

![](images/visual-editing-omni-math.png){fig-alt="There is a line of text (with a cursor at the end) where someone has typed '/ma'. There is a drop-down menu underneath this with options for 'Inline Math', 'Display Math', and 'Image...' arranged vertically. The title of each item is bolded, has a small icon to the left, and a small description in lighter gray text underneath it."}
:::

If you are at the beginning of a line (as displayed above), you can also enter plain `/` to invoke the shortcut.

### Editor Toolbar

The editor toolbar includes buttons for the most commonly used formatting commands:

Additional commands are available on the **Format**, **Insert**, and **Table** menus:

| Format                                                                                           | Insert                                                                                           | Table                                                                                          |
